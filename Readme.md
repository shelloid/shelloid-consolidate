# Shelloid-consolidate

  A customized clone of the Consolidate.js module for integration with Shelloid application server. You won't need to directly use this module - this is internally used by Shelloid. If you're looking to work across different templating engines in a Node.js project (not using Shelloid) please use the original Consolidate.js library.
